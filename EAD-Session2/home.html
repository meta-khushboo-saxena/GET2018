						<p align="justify">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the
							printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
							industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
							unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
							type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
							also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
							unchanged.</p>
						<p align="justify">Where does it come from? Contrary to
							popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
							roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making
							it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
							Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
							obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
							going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
							discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from
							sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum".</p>
